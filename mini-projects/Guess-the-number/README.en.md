# Guess the number

# How it works:

The computer selects a random number (from 0 to 10).  
The player also selects a number from 0 to 10.
If the numbers match, the console will display: “You guessed the number.” If not, you did not guess correctly.  
As a result, you have a second chance. If you do not guess correctly again, the console will display: “You lost, the game is over, the computer's number was ...”.
